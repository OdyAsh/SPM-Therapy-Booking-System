8 functions will be written under scope

1 function with old method --> its effort estimation with COCOMO 81
1 function with new method --> its effort estimation is COCOMO II

amount of effort estimation is in PM (Person-Months)

sys. organic/embedded/semi-detached based on each function, not all system.
the justification of which one you choose is only 2 lines.

page 4:
probably also in the exam

page 7:
justify each driver you choose (FLEX, etc) in one or two lines.
since we're justifying on the function not the whole system.
Therefore we will mention from the labs the justification but the 

early design --> analysis & design phases
post architecture --> implementation & testing

The COCOMO tables are in COCOMO II
